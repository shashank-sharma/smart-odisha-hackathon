                    - When you deal with cyberbullying, you need to look at the fact that these cyberbullies are simply
                    trying to get a rise out of you overreacting. Cyberbullies are harmful because they rarely think of
                    the consequences of their actions. This makes them a double-edged sword. If handled carefully, we can cut them
                    but if we handle them carelessly, they may be able to cause unwanted devastation. <br> <br>
                    - Their anonymity is also a constant threat. You can be cyberbullied by a complete stranger or a close acquaintance
                    without ever being able to tell who the culprit is. Bullies may feel empowered to say and do more
                    destructive things than they would face-to-face when they are interacting with their victims screen-to-screen. <br> <br>
                    - It can be nearly impossible to rid the internet of offensive material that a cyberbully makes public; once a photo,
                    rumor, or video has made it into a cyberspace, it becomes persistant. <br> <br>
                    -Cyberbullying follows you home. A student being bullied at school may find
                    refuge in other spaces, but a victim of cyberbullying is connected to his or
                     her tormentors whenever he or she is
                    connected to a cell phone or computerâ€”which for many teens is all the time.

            - Cyberbullying involves posting pictures and mean comments,
            spreading rumors and lies, and humiliating or attacking someone
             without their consent. If you want to stop this malicious behavior in it's tracks, don't forward hateful emails or content
            to your friends. Forwarding this type of information will feed into it and even implicate you as a cyber bully.<br></br>
            - If you receive a hurtful and harassing form of electronic content toward another person, whether you know the person or not,
             reply to them and let them know cyberbullying is hurtful. Explain to them that the person being attacked could easily be a
              close friend or family member and that you're pretty sure their loved ones would be outraged; not to mention the person
              being attacked. Some say it's best not to respond to the bully since that's exactly what they want. This may be true,
               however if you respond only once to everyone receiving the email from the cyberbullying, reminding them they are causing
              more harm by forwarding the hurtful email on, it might send a strong message.<br></br>
              - Block, report, and flag any and all content by a cyber bully. This sends a strong statement that you
               won't condone this type of internet behavior, nor can your sense of right and wrong be penetrated by
                feeding into it for the sake of a good laugh. Adults are just as vulnerable as teenagers when it comes to cyberbullying.
               They too will second guess themselves and assume they are a joke. No one is immune to the effects of
                cyberbullying, not even adults. <br></br>
                - Somtimes if you are lucky, you might be able to click on the cyberbully's username
                and find a link to some of their information. This information may include their website and even place of work.
                If a bully feels they have a right to vicitimize and humiliate a perfectly good stranger, we don't see why that
                perfectly good stranger can't write a letter to the cyberbully's place of work and let them
                know what type of person they have employed at their business by informing them of their cruel cyberbully activities.
